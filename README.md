CannonAttackJava
================

This is an example test driven development project inspired by [Dom Miller's blog][1], and ported to Java by myself.

The Goal is to hit a cannonball within fifty yards of a target distance by guessing an angle, and muzzle velocity of a cannonball.

Requirements
---

- Demonstrate the Software Development Lifecycle, and Test Driven Development methodology.
- Produce a random goal distance, and display it to the user.
- Prompt the user for distance, and speed, and recieve input as integers.
- validate speed between 1 and the speed of light in m/s
- accept angles from 1 to 90 degrees.
